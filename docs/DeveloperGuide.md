## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. The system should efficiently manage up to 1000 patients or appointments without any noticeable performance lag during typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks within 40 seconds using CLI commands.
4. All error messages should clearly indicate how to correct the invalid input.
5. Data files should be compatible across different OS platforms.
6. All functionality should be accessible via keyboard-only commands.

## Glossary
* *Mainstream OS* - Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS
* *Performance Lag* – A noticeable delay or slowdown in the system’s response to user actions.
* *Error Messages* – System-generated messages that inform users of incorrect input and provide guidance on how to fix it.
* *OS Platform Compatibility* – The ability for data files and system functionality to work consistently across different operating systems.

## Instructions for manual testing

{Give instructions on how to do a manual product testing e.g., how to load sample data to be used for testing}
